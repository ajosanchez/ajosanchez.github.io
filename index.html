            <h2>Career Summary</h2>
            <p>Passionate Data Scientist with a background in finance, I transitioned to data science out of a 
                deep-seated enthusiasm for machine learning in 2017. With 7 years of consulting experience, I've collaborated with 
                diverse clients globally, adapting swiftly to new technologies and varied problem sets. This versatility 
                is underpinned by a commitment to lifelong learning, exemplified by completing a Master's in Computer 
                Science during the COVID-19 lockdown while working full-time. My journey is characterized by a continuous 
                quest for knowledge and a zeal for applying innovative data solutions to real-world challenges.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Sr. ML Engineer, Slalom Inc.</h3>
                    <p>May 2019 - Present</p>
                    <p>At Slalom, my journey began as a Data Scientist where I developed machine learning models for predicting 
                        housing demand. With growing expertise, my role evolved into a more comprehensive ML Engineering position, 
                        focusing on productionalizing models and crafting MLOps pipelines on platforms like AWS and Google Cloud. 
                        Notable projects include constructing real-time fraud detection training and deployment pipelines, 
                        developing forecasting pipelines for global energy consumption, and building training and inference 
                        pipelines for image classification. As I progressed, I also assumed leadership responsibilities, guiding 
                        small to medium teams of data scientists, ML engineers, and data engineers in delivering client solutions. 
                        In my current role, I blend my advanced technical skills with leadership, functioning as both a senior data 
                        scientist and an ML engineer, driving projects to fruition and mentoring teams for success.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Data Scientist, Neal Analytics</h3>
                    <p>December 2017 - April 2019</p>
                    <p>As a Data Scientist at Neal Analytics, I specialized in predictive analytics and forecasting, leveraging 
                        Python and Databricks to deliver data-driven insights. My key projects included developing models to 
                        forecast livestock prices, retail demand, and financial services needs, showcasing my ability to handle 
                        diverse data sets and industries. Additionally, I led a clustering analysis project for an international 
                        food distributor, effectively segmenting retailers to optimize distribution strategies. My role demanded a 
                        blend of technical expertise, industry knowledge, and problem-solving skills, contributing significantly to 
                        data-informed decision making for our clients.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Mortgage Specialist, BECU & Homestreet Bank</h3>
                    <p>December 2008 - June 2016</p>
                    <p>Prior to my transition into data science, I spent eight years in the banking sector, initially as a 
                        Personal Banker and Loan Officer. In this role, I specialized in consumer lending, handling auto loans and 
                        credit card applications, and making key decisions on approvals and credit limits. I later advanced to 
                        mortgage lending, managing a pipeline of loans from application through to funding. It was during this 
                        phase that my interest in technology deepened, leading me to explore web development and machine learning. 
                        This newfound passion culminated in obtaining a Machine Learning specialization from the University of 
                        Washington, marking my transition out of banking to pursue a full-time career in data science and machine 
                        learning.</p>
